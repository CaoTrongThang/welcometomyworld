# ❗DON'T DOWNLOAD, YOU'LL LOSE YOUR ITEMS, I MADE THIS MOD FOR MY EASYCRAFT MODPACK!!!

I uploaded this mod here for me to make it easier to update the mod, could make it configurable but not right now.

**This mod adds a little spice up to my current modpack, it's included with features:**
1. Falling into liquid (water, lava,...) still gets damaged.
1. Punching blocks with barehand gets damaged.
1. Breaking blocks has a chance to spawn mobs.
1. Beds have a chance of exploding when a player is sleeping on them (having luck, holding a flower, sleeping near a sleeping friend or a campfire will decrease the chance)
1. Nearby hostile mobs have a chance to be powered up by giving effects such as speed, strength, haste, regeneration, and resistance. If they already had that effect, the effect will increase its level.
1. Swimming underwater without a helmet can lead to nausea.
1. There's a small chance a strong mob will be spawned near the players, It'll drop the Materials that can be used to craft Ancient Items.
1. Lightnings strike players when in the rain.
1. Hostile Mobs now immune to sunlight.


**AI:**
1. Phantoms can grab players up to the sky and immune to sunlight.
1. Spiders can shoot cobweb to stop players from moving.
1. Endermans can toy with you really hard, just don't look.
1. Zombies now can place blocks (combine with Improved Mob to break blocks)

**Entities:**
1. Oak log: it's just a block but can move around and use meal bone on saplings
1. Peony flower: a flower than can move and give players luck buff.

**Not really impact the gameplay features:**
1. Day and night counter with a little animation.
1. Switch to third person when dead. (and switch back to the previous perspective after respawning)
1. Give players starting items when first joining the world.
1. Dramatic Intro.
1. Many New Achievements.


**New recipes and drops:**
1. 4 sticks -> oak planks
1. New 9 ancient Items.
